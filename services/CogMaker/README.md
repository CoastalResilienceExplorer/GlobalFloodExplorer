## Purpose
To auto-generate Cloud-Optimized GeoTiffs.
To prevent PubSub from retrying on a long-running task, I had to use a front service that forwards the requests.

## TODOs
- Error handling in Eventarc.  Currently Eventarc keeps retrying, we need it to just fail, and ideally to notify us.
- Add success/failure notifications on completion.
- Proper testing.
